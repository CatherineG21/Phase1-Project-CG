# Phase1-Project-CG
## Overview
This project analyzes historical aviation accident data from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The goal is to support investors and aviation stakeholders in identifying aircraft models with lower risk profiles to guide safer, more informed investment decisions.
## Project Objective
The primary goal is to identify aircraft with lower risk profiles based on historical safety data. To achieve this, I have analyzed trends, cleaned and scored the data and visualized insights that lead to practical recommendations. Future directions include expanding the scope and integrating predictive analytics. 
## Why Aircraft Risk Matters in Aviation Investment
In aviation, safety is a critical factor influencing operational costs, insurance premiums, and reputation. With many stakeholders eyeing fleet expansion or acquisitions, understanding historical safety trends enables better risk assessment and strategic decisions. The main goal is to demystify accident patterns and highlight safer aircraft options using data science.
## Aviation Accident Dataset Overview
The data used in this analysis was sourced from the NTSB. After cleaning the dataset, I focused on essential variables like Event Year, Aircraft Make/Model, Average Risk Sore, Total Fatalities, Location and Weather Condition
## Data Analysis Work
Data Cleaning – Removed irrelevant or missing values and standardized column names.

Exploratory Analysis – Identified trends in aircraft models and accident causes.

Risk Scoring – I created a risk score based on incident frequency per aircraft.

Visualization – Built Tableau dashboards to reveal insights (e.g., top models by incident rate).

Recommendations – Highlighted models with the lowest relative risk.

## Top Low-Risk Aircraft Models
This analysis ranks aircraft by accident frequency and risk score. A popular model like the Cessna 152 show high incident counts. Aircraft like the Gates Learjet LR-35A and Gilbert SX300 show very few incidents, suggesting lower operational risk.
Recommendation:Prioritize aircraft with low risk scores and few historical incidents, but also consider factors like usage, support, and intended purpose.

## Project Evaluation and Future Directions
While the model effectively identifies low-risk aircraft using historical data, future enhancements include:

Incorporating global datasets for broader scope.

Including maintenance logs, pilot experience, and weather data.

Using machine learning models to predict incident likelihoods.

This will provide an even more robust framework for aviation safety assessment.
